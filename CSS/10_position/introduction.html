    <h2>Introduction of css Position</h2>
    <p>
      The position property in CSS tells about the method of positioning for an
      element or an HTML entity and the positioning of an element can be done
      using the top, right, bottom, and left properties. These specify the
      distance of an HTML element from the edge of the viewport.
    </p>

    <h3>
      There are five different types of position properties available in CSS:
    </h3>
    <div class="container" id="fixed">
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Fixed position:</strong> Any HTML element with position: fixed
          property will be positioned relative to the viewport. An element with
          fixed positioning allows it to remain in the same position even we
          scroll the page. We can set the position of the element using the top,
          right, bottom, and left.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Static:</strong> This method of positioning is set by default.
          If we don't mention the method of positioning for any element, the
          element has the position: static method by default. By defining
          Static, the top, right, bottom, and left will not have any control
          over the element. The element will be positioned with the normal flow
          of the page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Relative:</strong> An element with position: relative is
          positioned relatively with the other elements which are sitting on top
          of it. If we set its top, right, bottom, or left, other elements will
          not fill up the gap left by this element. An element with its position
          set to relative and when adjusted using top, bottom, left, and right
          will be positioned relative to its original position.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Absolute:</strong> An element with position: absolute will be
          positioned with respect to its nearest Non-static ancestor. The
          positioning of this element does not depend upon its siblings or the
          elements which are at the same level.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sticky:</strong> Element with position: sticky and top:0
          played a role between fixed & relative based on the position where it
          is placed. If the element is placed in the middle of the document then
          when the user scrolls the document, the sticky element start scrolling
          until it touched the top. When it touches the top, it will be fixed at
          the top place in spite of further scrolling. we can stick the element
          at the bottom, with the bottom property.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
